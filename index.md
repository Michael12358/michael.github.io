>When you start a business, you need a bucket full of money
>Manfred von Schierach, my former boss at Hydranautics

He said that to me when I presented my resignation. He was totally right, most likely believed that I could not raise the funds to start my first company. Shortly after we managed to raise our first €3.5M to get inge AG started. Our technology was so early in the market that we needed to spend €20M to reach €10M in revenue. Nonetheless the company sold at 7x revenue
