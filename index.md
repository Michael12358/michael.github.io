### Lessons learned
#### Into the great wide open
>"When you start a business, you need a bucket full of money"
>(Manfred von Schierach, my former boss at Hydranautics, first employment after graduation)

He said that to me when I presented my resignation to him to leave from corporate into self-employment. He was totally right, we found! Nonetheless we managed to get a great group of people together and shortly after we managed to raise our first €3.5M to get inge AG started, despite the burst of the internet-bubble back in late 2000. Our technology was so revolutionary in the market that we needed to spend €20M to reach €10M in revenue and build up production. Nonetheless the company sold at 7x revenue later on and is still technology leader.

All over I have lived through three major market crisis in my entrepreneurial life, including Covid just recently. We have fought through all of them, always as a team. It was always tough, but looking back during those times I learned a lot about the people I dealt with and still do today.

After having raised over €25M+ in my venture career, founded, raised and sold two companies successfully and while being in the process of getting the third one started, here are: 

#### Some of my key take aways
- Helping others to me is the most rewarding experience
- Family is your last resort when things get rough
- Moving forward is all a matter of perserverance and persistance
- One needs friends, in private, but also in business
- In business or sports, one never races others, but only oneself
- Knowledge matters (that's why I keep continuously learning)
- People matter

### Favourite books
